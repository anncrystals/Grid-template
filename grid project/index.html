            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
            themselves.getting guidance from them and learning from their
            experience was easy
          </h2>
          <p class="gray">
            The staff seems genuinely concerned about my progress which i find
            really refreshing.the program gave me the confidence necessary to be
            able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
            developer.the standard is above the rest you will get the personal
            attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
            people

          <p class="gray5">
            before joining the bootcamp.ive never written a line of code.i
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step.i was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program.the entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.they were
            very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance.the agile
            team project,in particular was outstanding.it took my learning to
            the next level in a way that no tutorial could never have.infact,ive
            often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
            development experience.it certainly helped me land a job as a
            full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.100%
            recommended
